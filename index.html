## What I am working on now

### learning elm
Taking another stab at this functional programming language. Is it a DSL? who knows, who cares, so long as it is fun!

### Azure and Bash for Linux integration
Developed a solution that transfers static files from a linux server to an Azure Blob Container. Uses Azure CDN to serve over HTTPS.
