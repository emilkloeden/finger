## What I am working on now

### libsa

This package provides python bindings to query and access Libraries SA including searching by title, author and ISBN, as well as placing holds and changing credentials.

It's practically done.

### qqg and qqg-rs

QQG or "quack quack go" is a simple command line utility that queries DuckDuckGo's HTML search application. By default it returns results in Markdown format but passing a flag returns it in JSON.

With help from ChatGPT, I translated this from [python](https://github.com.emilkloeden/qqg) into [rust](https://github.com.emilkloeden/qqg-rs) and manually deployed linux and windows binaries.
